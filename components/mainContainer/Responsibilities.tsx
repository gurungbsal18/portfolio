          As a UI/UX Designer and Website Designer, my responsibilities
          encompass creating user-focused, visually appealing, and functional
          designs for both software applications and websites. In my UI/UX
          capacity, I design intuitive interfaces by conducting user research,
          developing wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups, and
          performing usability testing to refine the user experience. I
          collaborate with product managers, developers, and stakeholders to
          align designs with user needs and business objectives, ensuring
          accessibility, responsiveness, and a consistent design language across
          platforms. My work includes defining visual elements such as
          typography, color schemes, and layouts while adhering to brand
          standards and optimizing for various devices.

          As a Website Designer, I focus on crafting engaging and effective web
          experiences tailored to the company’s digital presence. This involves
          designing website layouts, landing pages, and interactive elements
          that enhance navigation and drive user engagement. I ensure websites
          are aesthetically cohesive, optimized for performance, and aligned
          with SEO best practices in collaboration with developers and marketing
          teams. Across both roles, I stay current with design trends, tools,
          and technologies to deliver innovative solutions that elevate the
          company’s software products and online identity.
